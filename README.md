# Workshop PediPaper GO

A GitHub Pages friendly web app for a location-based team quiz. Teams use one phone, choose a team name, answer 15 questions in 5 batches of 3, and unlock the next batch only when they reach the next checkpoint area.

## What this project does

- Hosts the website on GitHub Pages.
- Stores team names, answers, stage progress, and scores online in Supabase.
- Shows the next checkpoint only after each batch is submitted.
- Uses browser geolocation to unlock each next batch when the team is within a configurable radius, default 50 m.
- Includes a quizmaster dashboard with a password gate and CSV export.

## Important security note

Because GitHub Pages is a static hosting service, it cannot keep real secrets on the server side. GitHub says Pages publishes static files from a repository, and GitHub Pages itself is a static site hosting service. citeturn970585search0turn970585search3

That means the password `HAKUNAMATATA` in `admin.html` is only a front-end lock for convenience. It is **not secure** against a technical user who opens the browser developer tools.

If you want real protection for the quizmaster data, move the admin view to a backend or add Supabase Auth / Edge Functions so only authenticated quizmasters can read the full table. Supabase's JavaScript client supports database access and auth flows from browser apps. citeturn970585search1turn970585search19

## Why GitHub Pages + Supabase

GitHub Pages works well here for the public interface, but shared online data needs a backend. Supabase provides a hosted Postgres database and JavaScript client that works directly from the browser. citeturn970585search1turn970585search16

Also, browser geolocation requires a secure context. MDN documents the Geolocation API as available only in secure contexts, such as HTTPS, which GitHub Pages provides. citeturn970585search2turn970585search8

## Files

- `index.html` — team interface
- `admin.html` — quizmaster dashboard
- `style.css` — styling
- `app.js` — game logic and location gating
- `admin.js` — dashboard logic
- `config.example.js` — fill in your real Supabase keys, password, questions, and coordinates
- `schema.sql` — starter database table and MVP policies

## Setup steps

### 1. Create a Supabase project

Create a new Supabase project and copy:

- Project URL
- Public anon key

Supabase documents the browser JavaScript client and installation here. citeturn970585search1turn970585search10

### 2. Create the database table

Run the SQL from `schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor.

### 3. Configure the quiz

Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js` and fill in:

- `supabaseUrl`
- `supabaseAnonKey`
- `quizmasterPassword`
- all 5 checkpoints with real `lat`, `lng`, `description`
- all 15 questions and `correctAnswer`

The template is already split into 5 checkpoints × 3 questions.

### 4. Push to GitHub

Create a repo, add these files, and push.

### 5. Enable GitHub Pages

In the repo settings, enable GitHub Pages and publish from the branch/folder you prefer. GitHub documents the publishing source configuration in their Pages docs. citeturn970585search15

## How the flow works

1. Team enters a team name.
2. The team row is created online in Supabase.
3. The first 3 questions are shown immediately.
4. After submitting, the next checkpoint clue and map link appear.
5. The team taps **Check my location**.
6. If they are within `unlockRadiusMeters` of the checkpoint, the next 3 questions unlock.
7. Repeat until checkpoint 5.
8. After the final submit, the total score is shown and also stored online.

## Current MVP limitations

- Team identity is based on team name and the browser's saved last team name.
- The quizmaster password is not truly secure on static hosting.
- The starter SQL allows public reads/writes so the MVP works quickly.
- There is no anti-cheat protection if someone inspects the frontend or network calls.

## Recommended secure upgrade

For a production event, I recommend this architecture:

- Public team page on GitHub Pages.
- Supabase Edge Functions for submissions and admin data access.
- A hidden admin page protected with Supabase Auth or magic-link login.
- Database policies that prevent teams from reading other teams' answers.
- Optionally generate a unique private token per team at registration.

## Customization ideas

- Add multiple-choice questions.
- Show a live leaderboard after the event ends.
- Add checkpoint images.
- Add time bonuses or penalties.
- Add a countdown timer.
